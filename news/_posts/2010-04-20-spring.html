<h2>Release v1.4.2</h2>
<h3>Spring 2010</h3>

<p>{{ page.summary }}</p>

<p>
Usability, bells and whistles
<ul>
<li>Added support for the configurable <em>guitool.[tool].*</em>
actions as described in
<em><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">git-config(1)</a></em>.
<br />
This makes it possible to add new actions to <em>git-cola</em>
by simply editing <em>~/.gitconfig</em>.  This implements the
same guitool support as `git-gui`.
<br/>
<strong>Closed <a href="http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/44">
issue #44</a></strong>.</li>

<li>Introduced a stat cache to speed up <em>git-config</em> and
repository status checks.</li>

<li>Added Alt-key shortcuts to the main `git-cola` interface.</li>

<li>The `Actions` dock widget switches between a horizontal
and vertical layout when resized.</li>

<li>We now use <em>git diff --submodule</em> for submodules
(used when git &gt;= 1.6.6).</li>

<li>The context menu for modified submodules includes an option
to launch <em>git-cola</em>.

<strong>Closed <a href="http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/17">
issue #17</a></strong>.
<br />

<li>Prefer <em>$VISUAL</em> over <em>$EDITOR</em> when both are defined.
These are used to set a default editor in lieu of <em>core.editor</em>
configuration.</li>

<li>Force the editor to be <em>gvim</em> when we see <em>vim</em>.
This prevents us from launching an editor in the (typically
unattached) parent terminal and creating zombie editors
that cannot be easily killed.</li>

<li>Selections are remembered and restored across updates.
This makes the `partial-staging` workflow easier since the
diff view will show the updated diff after staging.</li>

<li>Show the path to the current repository in a tooltip
over the commit message editor.
<br />
<strong>Closed <a href="http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/45">
issue #45</a></strong>.</li>

<li>Log internal <em>git</em> commands when <em>GIT_COLA_TRACE</em>
is defined.

</ul>

<p>
Fixes
<ul>
<li>Improved backwards compatibility for Python 2.4.</li>

<li><em>Review mode</em> can now review the current branch; it no longer
requires you to checkout the branch into which the reviewed
branch will be merged.</li>

<li>Guard against <em>color.ui = always</em> configuration when using
<em>git log</em> by passing <em>--no-color</em>.</li>

<li><em>yes</em> and <em>no</em> are now supported as valid booleans
by the <em>git config</em> parser.

<li>Better defaults are used for `fetch`, `push`, and `pull`.

<p>
Packaging
<ul>

<li>Removed colon (`:`) from the applilcation name on Windows
<br />
<strong>Closes <a href="http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/41">
issue #41</a></strong>.</li>

<li>Fixed bugs with the Windows installer
<br />
<strong>Closes <a href="http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/40">
issue #40</a></strong>.</li>

<li>Added a more standard i18n infrastructure.  The install
tree now has the common <em>$prefix/share/locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES/git-cola.mo</em>
layout in use by several projects.</li>

<li>Started trying to accomodate Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
in the <em>darwin/</em> build scripts but our tester is yet to
report success building a <em>.app</em> bundle.</li>

<li>Replaced use of <em>perl</em> in Sphinx/documentation Makefile
with more-portable <em>sed</em> constructs.  Thanks to
Stefan Naewe for discovering the portability issues and
providing msysgit-friendly patches.</li>

</ul>
