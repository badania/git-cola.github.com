<h2>Release v1.4.1.2</h2>
<h3>New Years Eve 2009</h3>

<p>{{ page.summary }}</p>

<p>
Usability, bells and whistles
<ul>
<li>
It is now possible to checkout from the index as well as from HEAD.
This corresponds to the 'Removed Unstaged Changes' action in the
'Repository Status' tool.
</li>
<li>
The remote dialogs (fetch, push, pull) are now slightly larger by default.
</li>
<li>
Bookmarks can be selected when 'git-cola' is run outside of a Git repository.
</li>
<li>
Added more user documentation.
We now include many links to external git resources.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Fixes
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a missing import when showing right-click actions for
unmerged files in the 'Repository Status tool'.
</li>
<li>
'git update-index --refresh' is no longer run everytime
'git cola version' is run.
</li>
<li>
Donâ€™t try to watch non-existant directories when using inotify.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Packaging
<ul>
<li>
The 'Makefile' will now conditionally include a config.mak file
located at the root of the project. This allows for user customizations
such as changes to the prefix variable to be stored in a file so that
custom settings do not need to be specified every time on the command-line.
</li>
<li>
The build scripts no longer require a .git directory to generate the
'builtin_version.py' module. The release tarballs now include a 'version'
file at the root of the project which is used in lieu of having the
Git repository available. This allows for 'make clean &amp;&amp; make'
to function outside of a Git repository.
</li>
<li>
Added maintainer's make dist target to the Makefile.
</li>
<li>
The built-in 'simplejson' and 'jsonpickle' libraries can be excluded
from 'make install' by specifying the 'standalone=true' make variable.
For example, 'make standalone=true install'.
This corresponds to the '--standalone' option to 'setup.py'.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
